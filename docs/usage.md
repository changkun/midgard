# Midgard Usage

Midgard CLI offers several command to interact
with the midgard server and daemon.

## Status Check

Status check gives you option to check if everything is setup correctly:

```sh
$ mg status
server status: OK
daemon status: OK
```

## List Active Daemons

List active daemons allows you to check other connected daemon users:

```sh
$ mg daemon ls
2020/12/06 19:50:05 daemon.go:68: midgard: active daemons:
id      name
1       changkun-perflock
```

## Allocate A Global URL

You can use `midgard alloc` to allocate a global url to persist your data,
for example:

```sh
$ mg alloc /awesome/filename -f /path/to/your/file
DONE: https://changkun.de/data/awesome/filename
```

The first argument of `alloc` subcommand indicates the desired URI,
and `-f` flag indicates the file you want to put to your server.

You can omit the `-f` flag and leave it empty, then the `alloc` subcommand
will request the server to use your universal clipboard data.

You can even omit the argument of `alloc`, then the `midgard` server will
create a random path under `/random`. For instance:

```sh
$ mg alloc
DONE: https://changkun.de/data/random/fboVP8u4xNMHfvsv2EeLzL.txt
```

It automatically writes to your clipboard and you can directly paste
it to anywhere else that you want.

Moreover, to alloc a global URL, Midgard provides the following global
keyboard shortcut to trigger such an action:

- Linux: **Ctrl+Mod4+s**
- macOS: **Ctrl+Option+s**

## Universal Clipboard

`midgard` daemon watches your system clipboard and automatically sync
your clipboard with the `midgard` server. Thus, a possible usage of
`midgard` is:

1. Take a screenhot of your desktop,
2. Use `midgard new`

This will return you a public accessible URL and write back into your local
clipboard so that you can immediately paste to anywhere you want.

Furthermore, with the built-in universal clipboard, you can even share
your clipboard cross platforms (e.g. between Mac and Linux).
